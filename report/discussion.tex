\subsection{Results}\label{subsec:results}
a section presenting my results and comparing them to other results, might have to create some "artificial" results
to get anything good to compare with, like using linear interpolation as a baseline, and final ik as "competing"
solution, this is also a good place to show some concrete examples of what my models can do, using images

\subsection{Further research}\label{subsec:further-research}
as with all papers that are things that i did not get to explore, this will detail where i think further energy should
be exerted based on my findings.
