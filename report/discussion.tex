\subsection{Results}\label{subsec:results}
AE latent blending vs. VAE latent blending vs. linear interpolation (take a motion add gaps, fill gaps, record MSE)

insert some examples here (image sequences) of good results and bad results

\subsection{Further research}\label{subsec:further-research}
clustered-specialists-paper~\cite{won2020scalable}

something about motion prediction maybe (a way to utilize forwards/backwards info)

closer comparison with existing motion prediction models

using vq-vae

using the full amass data training
